# Japanese (jpn)


Contains paradigms for Japanese verbs


## Source

Seed verbs were collected from N5 (most basic) level of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) and lexical honorifics, as cited in [Hirabayashi and Hama (1988)][keigo]. Inflected forms were semi-mechanically generated with the rule-based verb inflection tool ([kamiya-codec][kamiya-codec]).
